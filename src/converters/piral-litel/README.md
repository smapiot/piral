This is a plugin that only has a peer dependency to `lit-element`. What `piral-litel` brings to the table is a set of Pilet API extensions that can be used with `piral` or `piral-core`.

The set includes a LitElement converter for any component registration, as well as a `fromLitEl` shortcut and a `LitElExtension` component.

By default, these API extensions are not integrated in `piral`, so you'd need to add them to your Piral instance.

## Documentation

The following functions are brought to the Pilet API.

### `fromLitEl()`

Transforms a standard LitElement component into a component that can be used in Piral, essentially wrapping it with a reference to the corresponding converter.

### `LitElExtension`

The name of the extension slot component to be used in LitElement components. This is usually not needed, as it is made available via a custom element named `litel-extension`. For safety measure `LitElExtension.name` could be used to find the name of the custom element.

## Usage

::: summary: Modern Use (recommended)

The recommended way is to use `piral-litel` from your pilets. In this case, no registration in the Piral instance is required.

Example use:

```ts
import { PiletApi } from '<name-of-piral-instance>';
import { fromLitel } from 'piral-litel/convert';
import './LitElPage';

export function setup(piral: PiletApi) {
  piral.registerPage('/sample', fromLitel('my-page'));
}
```

Within LitElement components the Piral LitElement extension component can be used by referring to `litel-extension`, e.g.,

```html
<litel-extension name="name-of-extension"></litel-extension>
```
:::

::: summary: Legacy Use

For backwards compatibility, you can also install `piral-litel` in your Piral instance.

Using LitElement with Piral is as simple as installing `piral-litel` and `lit-element@^2`.

```ts
import { createLitElApi } from 'piral-litel';
```

The integration looks like:

```ts
const instance = createInstance({
  // important part
  plugins: [createLitElApi()],
  // ...
});
```

The `lit-element` and `@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs` packages should be shared with the pilets via the *package.json*:

```json
{
  "importmap": {
    "imports": {
      "@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs": "",
      "lit-element": ""
    }
  }
}
```

## Preparing Pilets

Unfortunately, LitElement is quite sensitive regarding how its transpiled. Right now the only way to be sure that classes are indeed transpiled as they should (from perspective of LitElement) is to place the following snippet in the *package.json* of each pilet using `piral-litel`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "browserslist": [
    "last 1 chrome versions"
  ],
  // ...
}
```

This will make sure that ES6 classes are used, which is required for web components to work properly.
