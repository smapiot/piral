This plugin enables using [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org) as the bundler for Piral instances and pilets.

## Installation

Use your favorite NPM client for the installation:

```sh
npm i piral-cli-webpack5 --save-dev
```

**Note**: The plugin has to be installed to tell the `piral-cli` to use Webpack v5 as the default bundler.

## Using

There is nothing to do. Standard commands such as `piral build` or `pilet debug` will now work with Webpack as the bundler.

This plugin comes with batteries included. You don't need to install or specify your Webpack version.

### What's Inside

Right now it includes:

- `babel-loader`,
- `css-loader`,
- `file-loader`,
- `source-map-loader`,
- `sass-loader`,
- `style-loader`,
- `ts-loader`,
- `parcel-codegen-loader`,
- `import-maps-webpack-plugin`,
- `html-webpack-plugin`,
- `mini-css-extract-plugin`,
- `optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin`,
- `terser-webpack-plugin`,
- `webpack`, and
- `webpack-dev-server`.

As such it should be prepared to include assets (images, videos, ...), stylesheets (CSS and SASS), and work with TypeScript.

### Customizing

You can still leverage your own `webpack.config.js`. Either just export *what you want to have overwritten*, e.g.,

```js
module.exports = {
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
};
```

or specify a function that is called with the already created configuration.

An example would be:

```js
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.plugins.push(myAwesomePlugin);
  config.entry.side = ['@babel/polyfill'];
  return config;
};
```

Your function may be async or return a Promise as needed.

Otherwise, you can also use the `extend-config` helper module to get the job done without having to know the internals:

```js
const extendConfig = require('piral-cli-webpack5/extend-config');

module.exports = extendConfig({
  checkTypes: true, // not only transpiles TS, but also checks the types
  noPresets: true, // removes existing presets from Babel
  rules: [], // adds additional rules
  removeRules: [], // removes the rules mentioned by their loader name
  plugins: [], // adds additional plugins
  removePlugins: [], // removes the plugins mentioned by their class reference
  fileLoaderOptions: {}, // sets the options for the file loader
  tsLoaderOptions: {}, // sets the options for the TS loader
  babelLoaderOptions: {}, // sets the options for the Babel loader
  cssLoaderOptions: {}, // sets the options for the CSS loader
  sassLoaderOptions: {}, // sets the options for the SASS loader
});
```

If you want to name your Webpack configuration different than `webpack.config.js` you can use the `--config` CLI option.

Example:

```sh
npx piral build --config my-webpack.js
```
