# Monorepo

While Piral was designed primarily for distributed development, i.e., where each microfrontend lives in its own repository, you can use Piral with any paradigm that you like. This includes having a monorepo, i.e., one repository where many (or all) of your pilets are developed.

Using a monorepo can have many advantages. However, keep in mind that some challenges arise, too. For instance, you'll have to take care that deployments are only done for the changed pilets otherwise you'll end up with a hidden monolith.

In this tutorial we'll walk over using Piral with a monorepo. We start by looking at the different types of repositories and distributed development strategies, before setting up a monorepo with [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) or [Rush](https://rushjs.io/).

## Types of Repositories

The first type is the "central monorepo". This may be among the most popular patterns for distributed frontends in general; a monorepo. As mentioned, the monorepo is a single repository that hosts multiple packages. There are many tools to create monorepos, applications such as Lerna, Rush, Nx, or Yarn (with Workspaces) are great tools to manage their complexity.

Another type is the "central pipeline", which decomposes the monorepo into individual repositories with one exception: The build pipeline remains in the monorepo and aggregates the individual repositories into a single (fat) pipeline.

A third type is the "distributed monorepo". In the previous pattern we scattered the repositories, but kept the single pipeline. What if we wanted to do it the other way round? Does it even make sense? It turns out, it may be useful. Potentially, we want to develop the UI incl. all fragments in a central place, but we still want to leave room for each team to have their own deployment processes.

Finally, the type of repositories where Piral shines fully is "independent repositories". This is the hardest to achieve correctly, and therefore the perfect use case for Piral. In this type you will be having totally independent repositories with their own build processes giving each team full autonomy.

Of course, hybrids of these types are legit, too.

## Strategies with Piral

Independent of the reasons for choosing a monorepo you'll potentially desire one of the following compositions in your monorepo.

- Piral instance with helper libraries (shell monorepo)
- Piral instance with selected pilets (core monorepo)
- A collection of pilets (domain monorepo)

Any of these types may make sense depending on your problem and the available resources to solve it. From an implementation point of view, the Piral instance with selected pilets may be the most difficult to set up - which is why we'll focus on this one here. However, the other two would not be so different.

## Setting up a Monorepo
If you want to lean how to setup a monorepo with piral choose one of these two options:
- [Setting up a monorepo with piral and lerna](./23.1-monorepo-lerna.md)
- [Setting up a monorepo with piral and rush](./23.2-monorepo-rush.md)

## Conclusion

Setting up a monorepo with Piral requires some additional knowledge. Nevertheless, using the right steps and keeping an eye on things such as versioning, `dependencies` and `devDependencies` it is possible to come up with a decent solution that scales really well. What we did not cover is the CI/CD aspect, which will certainly be more complex to implement correctly than in the independent repositories case.

In the next tutorial, we'll look at a set of useful patterns to implement agile frontends using extension components.
